# Passport-Local Mongoose
Passport-Local Mongoose is a [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) [plugin](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/plugins.html) 
that simplifies building username and password login with [Passport](http://passportjs.org).

## Tutorials
Michael Herman gives a comprehensible walk through for setting up mongoose,
passport, passport-local and passport-local-mongoose for user authentication in his blog post [User Authentication With Passport.js](http://mherman.org/blog/2013/11/11/user-authentication-with-passport-dot-js/)


## Installation

```bash
$ npm install passport-local-mongoose
```

Passport-Local Mongoose does not require `passport`, `passport-local` or `mongoose` dependencies directly but expects you
to have these dependencies installed.

In case you need to install the whole set of dependencies

```bash
$ npm install passport passport-local mongoose passport-local-mongoose --save
```

### Updating from 1.x to 2.x
The default digest algorithm was changed due to security implications from **sha1** to **sha256**. If you decide
to upgrade a production system from 1.x to 2.x your users **will not be able to login** since the digest
algorithm was changed! In these cases plan some migration strategy and/or use the **sha1** option for the 
digest algorithm.

## Usage

### Plugin Passport-Local Mongoose
First you need to plugin Passport-Local Mongoose into your User schema

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');

const User = new Schema({});

User.plugin(passportLocalMongoose);

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', User);
```

You're free to define your User how you like. Passport-Local Mongoose will add a username, hash and salt field to store the username, the hashed password and the salt value.

Additionally Passport-Local Mongoose adds some methods to your Schema. See the API Documentation section for more details.

### Configure Passport/Passport-Local
You should configure Passport/Passport-Local as described in [the Passport Guide](http://passportjs.org/guide/configure/).

Passport-Local Mongoose supports this setup by implementing a `LocalStrategy` and serializeUser/deserializeUser functions.

To setup Passport-Local Mongoose use this code

```javascript
// requires the model with Passport-Local Mongoose plugged in
const User = require('./models/user');

// use static authenticate method of model in LocalStrategy
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(User.authenticate()));

// use static serialize and deserialize of model for passport session support
passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());
```

Make sure that you have a mongoose connected to mongodb and you're done.

#### Simplified Passport/Passport-Local Configuration
Starting with version 0.2.1 passport-local-mongoose adds a helper method `createStrategy` as static method to your schema.
The `createStrategy` is responsible to setup passport-local `LocalStrategy` with the correct options.

```javascript
const User = require('./models/user');

// CHANGE: USE "createStrategy" INSTEAD OF "authenticate"
passport.use(User.createStrategy());

passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());
```

The reason for this functionality is that when using the `usernameField` option to specify an alternative usernameField name, 
for example "email" passport-local would still expect your frontend login form to contain an input field with name "username"
instead of email. This can be configured for passport-local but this is double the work. So we got this shortcut implemented.

### Options
When plugging in Passport-Local Mongoose plugin additional options can be provided to configure
the hashing algorithm.

```javascript
User.plugin(passportLocalMongoose, options);
```

__Main Options__

* saltlen: specifies the salt length in bytes. Default: 32
* iterations: specifies the number of iterations used in pbkdf2 hashing algorithm. Default: 25000
* keylen: specifies the length in byte of the generated key. Default: 512
* digestAlgorithm: specifies the pbkdf2 digest algorithm. Default: sha256. (get a list of supported algorithms with crypto.getHashes())
* interval: specifies the interval in milliseconds between login attempts. Default: 100
* usernameField: specifies the field name that holds the username. Defaults to 'username'. This option can be used if you want to use a different 
field to hold the username for example "email".
* usernameUnique : specifies if the username field should be enforced to be unique by a mongodb index or not. Defaults to true.
* saltField: specifies the field name that holds the salt value. Defaults to 'salt'.
* hashField: specifies the field name that holds the password hash value. Defaults to 'hash'.
* attemptsField: specifies the field name that holds the number of login failures since the last successful login. Defaults to 'attempts'.
* lastLoginField: specifies the field name that holds the timestamp of the last login attempt. Defaults to 'last'.
* selectFields: specifies the fields of the model to be selected from mongodb (and stored in the session). Defaults to 'undefined' so that all fields of the model are selected.
* usernameLowerCase: convert username field value to lower case when saving an querying. Defaults to 'false'.
* populateFields: specifies fields to populate in findByUsername function. Defaults to 'undefined'.
* encoding: specifies the encoding the generated salt and hash will be stored in. Defaults to 'hex'.
* limitAttempts: specifies whether login attempts should be limited and login failures should be penalized. Default: false.
* maxAttempts: specifies the maximum number of failed attempts allowed before preventing login. Default: Infinity.
* unlockInterval: specifies when user will be unlocked after the attempts reach to maximum number. Default: 600000.
* passwordValidator: specifies your custom validation function for the password in the form 'function(password,cb)'. Default: validates non-empty passwords.
* usernameQueryFields: specifies alternative fields of the model for identifying a user (e.g. email).
* findByUsername: Specifies a query function that is executed with query parameters to restrict the query with extra query parameters. For example query only users with field "active" set to `true`. Default: `function(model, queryParameters) { return model.findOne(queryParameters); }`. See the examples section for a use case.

*Attention!* Changing any of the hashing options (saltlen, iterations or keylen) in a production environment will prevent that existing users to authenticate!

#### Error Messages
Override default error messages by setting options.errorMessages.

* MissingPasswordError  'No password was given'
* AttemptTooSoonError 'Account is currently locked. Try again later'
* TooManyAttemptsError 'Account locked due to too many failed login attempts'
* NoSaltValueStoredError 'Authentication not possible. No salt value stored'
* IncorrectPasswordError 'Password or username are incorrect'
* IncorrectUsernameError 'Password or username are incorrect'
* MissingUsernameError 'No username was given'
* UserExistsError 'A user with the given username is already registered'
  
### Hash Algorithm
Passport-Local Mongoose use the pbkdf2 algorithm of the node crypto library. 
[Pbkdf2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) was chosen because platform independent
(in contrary to bcrypt). For every user a generated salt value is saved to make
rainbow table attacks even harder.

### Examples
For a complete example implementing a registration, login and logout see the 
[login example](https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose/tree/master/examples/login).

## API Documentation
### Instance methods

#### setPassword(password, cb) 
asynchronous method to set a user's password hash and salt

#### changePassword(oldPassword, newPassword, cb)
asynchronous method to change a user's password hash and salt. If oldPassword does
not match the user's old password an `IncorrectPasswordError` is passed to cb.

#### authenticate(password, cb)
asynchronous method to authenticate a user instance

### resetAttempts(cb)
asynchronous method to reset a user's number of failed password attempts (only defined if `options.limitAttempts` is true)

**callback arguments**
- err
  - null unless the hasing algorithm throws an error
- thisModel
  - the model getting authenticated *if* authentication was successful otherwise false
- passwordErr
  - an instance of `AuthenticationError` describing the reason the password failed, else undefined.

Using `setPassword()` will only update the document's password fields, but will not save the document.
To commit the changed document, remember to use Mongoose's `document.save()` after using `setPassword()`.

**Error Handling**  

* `IncorrectPasswordError`: specifies the error message returned when the password is incorrect. Defaults to 'Incorrect password'.
* `IncorrectUsernameError`: specifies the error message returned when the username is incorrect. Defaults to 'Incorrect username'.
* `MissingUsernameError`: specifies the error message returned when the username has not been set during registration. Defaults to 'Field %s is not set'.
* `MissingPasswordError`: specifies the error message returned when the password has not been set during registration. Defaults to 'Password argument not set!'.
* `UserExistsError`: specifies the error message returned when the user already exists during registration. Defaults to 'User already exists with name %s'.
* `NoSaltValueStored`: Occurs in case no salt value is stored in the MongoDB collection.
* `AttemptTooSoonError`: Occurs if the option `limitAttempts` is set to true and a login attept occures while the user is still penalized.
* `TooManyAttemptsError`: Returned when the user's account is locked due to too many failed login attempts.

All those errors inherit from `AuthenticationError`, if you need a more general error class for checking.


### Static methods
Static methods are exposed on the model constructor. For example to use createStrategy function use

```javascript
const User = require('./models/user');
User.createStrategy();
```

* authenticate() Generates a function that is used in Passport's LocalStrategy
* serializeUser() Generates a function that is used by Passport to serialize users into the session
* deserializeUser() Generates a function that is used by Passport to deserialize users into the session
* register(user, password, cb) Convenience method to register a new user instance with a given password. Checks if username is unique. See [login example](https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose/tree/master/examples/login).
* findByUsername() Convenience method to find a user instance by it's unique username.
* createStrategy() Creates a configured passport-local `LocalStrategy` instance that can be used in passport.

## Examples

### Allow only "active" users to authenticate

First we define a schema with an additional field `active` of type Boolean. 

```javascript
var UserSchema = new Schema({
  active: Boolean
});
```

When plugging in Passport-Local Mongoose we set `usernameUnique` to avoid creating a unique mongodb index on field `username`. To avoid
non active users to be queried by mongodb we can specify the option `findByUsername` that allows us to restrict a query. In our case
we want to restrict the query to only query users with field `active` set to `true`. The `findByUsername` MUST return a Mongoose query.

```javascript
UserSchema.plugin(passportLocalMongoose, {
  // Needed to set usernameUnique to true to avoid a mongodb index on the username column!
  usernameUnique: false,
  
  findByUsername: function(model, queryParameters) {
    // Add additional query parameter - AND condition - active: true
    queryParameters.active = true;
    return model.findOne(queryParameters);
  }
});
```

To test the implementation we can simply create (register) a user with field `active` set to `false` and try to authenticate this user
in a second step:

```javascript
var User = mongoose.model('Users', UserSchema);

User.register({username:'username', active: false}, 'password', function(err, user) {
  if (err) { ... }

  var authenticate = User.authenticate();
  authenticate('username', 'password', function(err, result) {
    if (err) { ... }

    // Value 'result' is set to false. The user could not be authenticated since the user is not active
    
  });
});
```
